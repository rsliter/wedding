  <h2>Hotels</h2>
  <p>We've contacted a handful of local hotels to secure room blocks on our wedding weekend.</p>

  <ul>

    <li>
    <div class='paragraph-group'>
      <p><a href='https://resweb.passkey.com/go/MartinSliterWedding'>Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge</a></p>
      <p>$289/night until August 17</p>
      <p>This is a 20-minute subway ride or a 15-minute taxi ride from our venue</p>
    </div>
    </li>

    <li>
    <div class='paragraph-group'>
      <p>Brooklyn Fairfield Inn</p>
      <p>$219/night</p>
      <p>This is a 10-minute taxi ride or a 1-mile walk from our venue</p>
    </div>
    </li>

    <li>
    <div class='paragraph-group'>
      <p>Marriott Downtown</p>
      <p>$239/night</p>
      <p>This hotel is a little further afield but could be a good option for folks who'd like to stay in Manhattan. It's a 30-minute subway ride to our venue.</p>
    </div>
    </li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Traveling with a group?</h2>

    <p>If you need to book more than one room for your stay, Airbnb might be a good option. It's a service that allows users to "rent" apartments in neighborhoods. We've personally used it when we've traveled and often prefer it as a way to save money on paragraph-groups and stay closer to a specific point of interest.</p>
    <p>Some great neighborhoods include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div class='paragraph-group'>
          <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/locations/new-york/park-slope">Park Slope</a>Park Slope is the neighborhood where our venue is located. It's quiet and gorgeous but isn't as well-connected on the subway to Manhattan.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class='paragraph-group'>
          <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/locations/new-york/prospect-heights">Prospect Heights</a>This neighborhood is within walking distance of our venue, offers a larger choice of restaurants than Park Slope, and is a little easier to get to Manhattan from.
