    Rebecca and Francisco met on a ski trip organized by their coworkers. They realized that they both lived in Chicago and began spending time after work together.

  About a year into their relationship, Francisco and Rebecca moved in together when they moved to Ecuador for work! They spent a year there, working and climbing mountains on the weekends.

    This past fall, Francisco organized a trip to the Catskills mountains, a couple hours away from New York City. After a day spent hiking they went out for a nice dinner. Back at their cabin afterwards, Francisco proposed to Rebecca.
